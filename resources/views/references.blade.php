        <p class="card-meta">Interactive online platform, similar to social media, reserved for programmers (programming humor and programming news).</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>DevException (DE)</strong> is an online platform meant to offer the viewer a large assortment of user-generated programming-based internet jokes or memes which they could then positively or negatively rate and/or share on other social media. It also includes the ability to share links of programming-related news, rather than just being a meme-platform.</p>
        <p>
DEâ€™s theme of humor is programming. If the user feels they fit within a certain niche (i.e., Java, HTML, CSS, C++, etc.) they could search the site with tags, finding the desired content with relative ease.
